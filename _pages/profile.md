## About

#ASKnet in full stands for Access to Skills and Knowledge network and is a consortium of community driven organizations with an aim to build a transformative and sustainable open society and a professional media ecosystem. The network
provides a platform for exchange and representation of South Sudanese interests in culture, society, technology, innovation, and business creating a basis for better communication and cooperation. #ASKnet provides access to knowledge,
media, archiving, and promoting an open culture in South Sudan.Thus fostering the creation and use of information as a
key factor for empowerment.

## Background

The program began in 2015 with the establishment of Juba‘s Open Knowledge and Innovation Hub (jHUB), a community-based open media training project that offered an open forum for discussing, identifying, and developing solutions
for South Sudan‘s post-conflict difficulties. The jHUB community was scattered towards the end of 2016 as the conflict
erupted once more. Since then, the program has developed into a network of smaller, community-driven hubs and organizations operating in South Sudan and Uganda. Now, efforts are being made to formalize the consortium and attract
additional initiatives with similar goals to join.

## Network Vision and Mission

In order to empower people in precarious situations, hubs and community-driven organizations create social structures
and provide access to information. A consortium made up of several organizations can help to amplify their voices and
activities and promote peer growth. The following vision and mission have been adopted by the consortium:

**Vision:** Build a transformative and sustainable media ecosystem.
