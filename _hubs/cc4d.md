CC4D-UGANDA aspires to implement sustainable community intervention initiatives targeted at positively transforming both the refugees and the communities that host them, with an emphasis on safe use of information and communication technology (ICT) while protecting the environment from global warming and improve the lives of both the refugees and host community in Uganda. Open access to information and Information broadcasting is an important aspect of our strategic plan to impact communities in which we operate. Improving the health and well-being of community residents is important to us, for example, through:

- Organizing repair caf√© events
- Advocacy on repair and reuse
- Access to information and Hardware
- Providing digital literacy skills
- Awareness raising on E-Waste management
- Collection and recycling of E-waste
- Promotion of peaceful coexistence
