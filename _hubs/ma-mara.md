Ma’Mara Sakit Village is a feminist community that amplifies voices and creates platforms and opportunities to facilitate processes that contribute to the attainment of individual and collective agency using research, art, culture, and multimedia.

‘Ma’Mara Sakit’ is a South Sudanese Arabic phrase that loosely translates to ‘not just a woman.’

The entity focuses on generating, raising, and facilitating sustainable funding processes for feminist informal groups, networks, and small organizations that funding agencies often discriminate against due to perceptions regarding their limited institutional capacity or registration status.
