ATAKA-HUB fosters peacebuilding through social media skills training, comedy theater, and gender equality awareness. We help the youth find self-employment opportunities by teaching them open tech and repair skills. We also use the cryptocurrency #eatBCH to provide food to the needy in Bor.

### Founding

For ATAKA founder Bior Ajang, it all started with a phone call. His good friend and co- founder of Platform Africa, Jaiksana Soro, invited him to take part in the #peacehackcamp in Juba in 2015. After attending, he realized that he now had skills to share and wanted to help others and so came up with the idea to found the ATAKA-HUB.

“I am going to make sure I will help the community, just like I was helped by my Aunty in my youth. That is why ATAKA’s focus is on the youth who dropped out of school and those who are interested in doing something for the community. If my aunt wouldn’t have taken me on, I wouldn’t have known that I could make it this far and do something for the community,” says Bior.

Michael Garang, member and trainer at ATAKA believes that “when there are problems in the community, many people expect that the solution will come from big people, mainly the government. Then we realized that blaming will bring no answers, so it is better to be part of the solution. Changing community life is a collective action.”
