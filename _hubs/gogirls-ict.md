GoGirls ICT Initiative is a Juba, South Sudan based non-profit initiative founded by a group of dedicated young women in the fields of Computer Science, Information Systems, ICT4D Innovation, hacktivism and peace-building. 

GoGirls ICT’s focus is on mentorship in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics) related topics leveraging more on Open Source resources to create an Open Culture in South Sudan. Founded in 2015, the Organization was finally registered as an independent Non-Governmental Organization in 2019.

The organization is part of the Global Innovation Gathering and Access to Skills and Knowledge network #ASKnet , while its founders have been featured on Eskills4girls’ The Storytellers: Experiences around the Globe
