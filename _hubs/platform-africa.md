Initiated by South Sudanese refugees to empower displaced people in Uganda, Platform Africa provides Training of Trainers (ToT) workshops within refugee communities that emphasize media literacy skills. The goal is to promote a peaceful coexistence between refugees and the host community of Arua through peacebuilding, radio programs, and psychological support. 

Platform Africa is a Community of Practice (CoP) that shares in its desire to collaborative network with other local peacebuilding organizations, engage in good documentation practices, and share knowledge and skills through sites such as Wikifab and Github.  

Platform Africa focus on the need for peacebuilding by strengthening storytelling, blogging, photography, and podcasting skills. This gives people a voice to discuss what is happening in their communities.
