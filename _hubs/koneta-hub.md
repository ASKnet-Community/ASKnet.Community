KONETA was founded with the aim of responding to the increasingly poor health, poor hygiene and sanitation, unsafe water, and Education challenges affecting many grassroots populations of South Sudan. KONETA is dedicated to supporting vulnerable communities (women, youth, and children being the immediate victims of any natural or man-made shock). We aim at achieving efficient, effective, and sustainable service provision, and to enable women and girls to have a healthy community at all levels. Seeks to impact the lives of people in South Sudan.

We engage in diverse sectors, including health, education, food security, protection and WASH with an understanding of the context of implementation as well organizational day-to-day requirements.
